                    In this adventure I decided to explore the hidden trails of the old Campbellville Quarry. I had heard that the area presented some fairly easy forest tracks to ride and figured let's take my 210kg adventure big on them. To my surprise the area was actually super nice to ride. The trails varied in difficulty but mostly stay fairly beginner. Most are plenty wide to turn around at any point, not that you will need to.
