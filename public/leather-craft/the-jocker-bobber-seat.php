                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>For my <a href="/builds/2002-yamaha-vstar-1100-bobber.php">2002 Yamaha V-Star 1100 Bobber - The Jocker Bobber</a> build I knew I wanted a retro style spring supported bobber seat, from my original designs. Having done some fabrication and leather work already on my previous builds I figured this would be a nice little project to take my skills further. I needed to make a seat pan, and then build a seat around it.</p>
                <p>I drew inspiration for the design from the seats available on the <a href="https://bluecollarbobbers.com">Blue Collar Bobbers</a> catalog, as well as the custom seat made by Spirit Leather for one of the Bobber Brothers Projects.</p>

                <h2>The Design</h2>
                <p>My design used a similar pattern with 2 kidney shaped patches on the top side of the seat in black, and brown leather all around them for the main body. Of course I started with bare vegetable tan leather, and died it myself. The bottom of the seat pan was wrapped in leather as well and died black. As for the interior of the seat I opted for putting in a Saddlemen Large Gel Pad with a bunch of carpet underlining foam I had laying around.</p>

                <h2>The Final Product</h2>
