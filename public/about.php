        <p>Balkan Moto was born out of the passion for motorcycles and learning practical skills. I knew I wanted to start building motorcycles and I loved the idea of having my own workshop, so I built this website. Here you can find everything about my experiences, learning, and builds of course.</p>
        <p>This website is one of 3 pieces that all work together to bring my work to the masses. The other 2 pieces are my YouTube channel and the my Instagram account.</p>
        <p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbSArk-BwFhFQmtV_ws2Ng" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel you can find the videos that show the progress of my builds, some cruises I take, and various tutorials. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/balkanmoto2018/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account on the other hand will feature images of different motorcycles that I spot in my everyday life. Images of popular builds from around the world that I draw inspiration from. As well as sneak peaks and more promotional material for my own builds.</p>
        <p>Late in 2020 I also got started on Leather Craft. Leather is such a versatile material to work with, and I've learned a ton playing around with it on personal project. So I figured it's time to showcase some of that work as well.</p>
