                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>After completing my <a href="/builds/1982-83-honda-sabre-v45-cafe-racer.php">1982-83 Honda Sabre V45 Cafe Racer - The Cafe Sabre</a> build, and deciding to sell off the bike I wanted to comemorate it by creating a wall piece. I had come across a nice schematic drawing of the motor of the bike from one of the service manuals, and immediately thought it be great to do a sort of blueprint for the whole bike.</p>
                <img src="/wall-art/img/cafe-sabre-blueprint/motor-blueprint.jpg">

                <h2>The Processes</h2>
                <p>I started the process by converting the motor blueprint from the service manual picture into something that I could actually use. A few filters and clicks, in photoshop, later and it was done. Then I figured I could probably do the same thing and just use a photo of the motorcycle to produce the bike blueprint. This didn't go that great...</p>
                <img src="/wall-art/img/cafe-sabre-blueprint/blueprint_v1.jpg" style="height:300px !important; width:200px !important;">
                <p>I also thought the blueprint was looking a little crowded with the rear 3/4 shot of the stock motorcycle from the service manual. So I ended up remove it and tracing the lines of the bike from the picture instead with paths. This produced an a bit better second version...but then I realized the picture I was using wasn't actually of the finished bike. So I had to adjust the lines further.</p>

                <p>After the final edits I knew I wanted it to be printed pretty large so I took the final file to Costco and got it printed at 24"x36" size on glossy poster paper. Then i found a picture frame off amazon that could fit such a size poster and put the two together.

                <h2>The Final Product</h2>
                <p>After getting the image printed and framed it now hangs on the wall above where the cafe racer used to stand.</p>
