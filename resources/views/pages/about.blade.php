        Balkan Moto was born out of the passion for motorcycles and learning practical skills. I knew I wanted to
        start building motorcycles and I loved the idea of having my own workshop, so I built this website. Here
        you can find everything about my experiences, learning, and builds of course.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is one of 3 pieces that all work together to bring my work to the masses. The other 2 pieces
        are my YouTube channel and the my Instagram account.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbSArk-BwFhFQmtV_ws2Ng" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
        channel you can find the videos that accompany the articles I post on here. These videos show the progress
        of my builds, they act as a visual aid to the tutorials, and of course show footage of the cruises I take.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/balkanmoto2018/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account on the other hand will feature images of different motorcycles that I spot in my
        everyday life. Images of popular builds from around the world that I draw inspiration from. As well as sneak
        peaks and more promotional material for my own builds.
